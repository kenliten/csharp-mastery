# My C# Mastery Journey

This repository is my jornal in the C# learning. Here I'm going to perform some journaling and save all my notes, experiments and learning projects, not only for me to reflect and be able to look back, but, for other to see what I did and how, so they can be somehow affected (in the best possible way) by my effort.

So, first, I want to share my motivation, my initial thoughts, and my reasons to pick C# and .net.

## My motivation

Why in the world would I, a web developer, go now for a language like C#, would you ask, and I understand why.

My main reason to be in tech is that I love innovation, creating new things, but, I'm not talking about another app, I mean, like, real, impacful, meaningful creation, and, being honest, I believe the best place to disrupt and innovate in a meaningful way is the enterprise/corporate/business side of the world, that's it.

Now, even though this is a perfect pitch for me, maybe I wouldn't convince you about it, would I? I genuinely don't think so. But, yeah, I'm ok with that. So, let me put it like this:

I want to be able to create as much types of software as I posibly can, and even better if it is cross platform software.

Probably, you're thinking something like flutter would be better for me then, but, I still think the old C, C# or Java are much better choises for me.

Going forward, I'd say that, C# opens a couple doors for me both in the marketplace as an employee, adding this corporate valuable skill, and for my own ambitions, since, hey, I'm trying to build things I cannot do in the webapp world, put simple.

Think with C# and the .net platform, you can build desktop software, web apps, CLI and much more, so, I feel this is the path I need to go for, for real.

## Structure

This repository won't have a pro architecture or pro commits or pro anything, this is only a way to have everything together for my learning journey, a place I'll have always available all of my initial words on the topic to my reasoning remarks, my learning notes, all my learning projects and a little learning materials collection.

The structure for this repo is as follows:

- Learning Log.md -> My journal, containing my reasoning, notes, and reflections.
- Projects -> The projects I build
- Resources -> Learning resources I found worth of being shared
