# Student Grading Application

This is the first guided project in the C# training course from Microsoft Learning.

The goal is to build an application that displays the grade of some students for a certain class.

It is simply a way to reinforce how to perform basic operations in C#, it helps by practicing variable declaration, showing results to the application user, in my case using string interpolation (by the way, I should have use verbatim strings as well, since they are pretty new for me, unique for C#, I mean, I have never seen something like them before in any language, so, for me, it is, indeed, unique to C#) and casting values to ensure correctness in the displayed values.

There's no condition, no flow control, no input, just hard coded values and even hard coded results (the A and B, are my hard coded input, it would be realtime calculated in a real app).
