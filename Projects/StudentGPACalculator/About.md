# Student GPA Calculator

This is the second guided project of the C# learning path from Microsoft Learn.

This is a very simple project where you build a simple Grade Point Average calculator that takes predefined values and calculates the GPA by summing up the credit hours, the grade points and then dividing them to find the GPA value. Lastly, here you format the result as a decimal with two digits after the decimal point by the hard possible way XD to avoid using a library instead so, I guess the idea is to avoid using 3rd party code for now, and I think it's wonderful to focus in developing our skills rather than using someone else code. Loved it!
